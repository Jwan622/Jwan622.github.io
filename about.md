### A quick summary of me!

Hi, I'm Jeff!

Here's a quick summary of me and my life: My name is Jeffrey Wan. I grew up in New York City. My worst job ever was my highest paying ever: I was a revolting Wall St. trader. And my best job ever you ask? It was when I taught computer science and programming out in Lagos, Nigeria. Other jobs I've enjoyed were professional poker playing and tennis coaching. I've enjoyed these jobs because they've allowed me to learn about software, data analysis, statistics, and game theory. I enjoy learning and will continue to learn.
